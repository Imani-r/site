        amount of caffeine? If so, you're not alone. A recent

      <p>Check out the visualization I created below:</p>

      <p>
        And here is a summary of what I found interesting from the research
        process and from my visualization:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Caffeine is a naturally occurring compound found in up to 28 plants,
          which use it as a pesticide to protect themselves from insects and
          other pests. <strong>[1]</strong>
        </li>

        <li>
          I was surprised to learn that tea leaves actually contain more
          caffeine than coffee beans on a dry weight basis. However, when
          preparing a cup of tea, less dry leaf is needed than the amount of
          coffee beans required to make a coffee, which means the caffeine
          content in tea is lower per cup. <strong>[2]</strong>
        </li>

        <li>
          The caffeine content in a cup of tea can vary depending on several
          factors: <strong>[3]</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The type of tea leaf used</strong> - Generally, broken
              down tea leaves, like the ones found in tea bags, yield more
              caffeine compared to whole leaves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The amount of tea used</strong> - The more tea leaves used
              in brewing, the higher the amount of caffeine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Brewing time</strong> - The caffeine content in tea
              increases as the leaves are left to steep in hot water for a
              longer period of time. <strong>[4]</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Brewing temperature</strong> - The caffeine content in tea
              also increases with higher water temperatures because the hotter
              water accelerates the process of caffeine extraction from the
              leaves.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Finally, I found that it takes only about two cups of black tea to
          obtain about the same amount of caffeine as in a cup of coffee &mdash;
          I thought black tea had significantly less caffeine!
        </li>
      </ul>
