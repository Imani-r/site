I'm reading Peter Watt's Blindsight
So, some quick thoughts so far:
 - This is probably the hardest sci-fi I've ever read. Not difficult, but _hard-core_ sci-fi. It's rare to come across works of fiction that take the ideas they explore - in this case consciousness, AI, free will, etc. - this seriously.

 - Man, the narrator is suspicious on vampires, to put it very mildly.
