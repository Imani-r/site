# Are you drinking a safe amount of caffeine? Tea Edition

Are you a tea drinker who has ever wondered if you're consuming a safe amount of caffeine? If so, you're not alone. A recent [MakeoverMonday challenge](https://makeovermonday.co.uk/) [2023 week 9](https://www.vizwiz.com/2023/03/caffeine.html) on caffeine levels in coffee prompted me to explore what the data looks like for some common types of tea. I suspected many of us tea lovers - with our 5+ cups a day - may be unknowingly exceeding [the recommended daily limit for caffeine: 400mg](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678#:~:text=Up%20to%20400%20milligrams%20(mg,widely%2C%20especially%20among%20energy%20drinks.).

Check out the visualization I created below:

And here is a summary of what I found interesting from the research process and from my visualization:

- Caffeine is a naturally occurring compound found in up to 28 plants, which use it as a pesticide to protect themselves from insects and other pests. **[1]**
- I was surprised to learn that tea leaves actually contain more caffeine than coffee beans on a dry weight basis. However, when preparing a cup of tea, less dry leaf is needed than the amount of coffee beans required to make a coffee, which means the caffeine content in tea is lower per cup. **[2]**
- The caffeine content in a cup of tea can vary depending on several factors: **[3]**
    - **The type of tea leaf used** - Generally, broken down tea leaves, like the ones found in tea bags, yield more caffeine compared to whole leaves.
    - **The amount of tea used** - The more tea leaves used in brewing, the higher the amount of caffeine.
    - **Brewing time** - The caffeine content in tea increases as the leaves are left to steep in hot water for a longer period of time. **[4]**
    - **Brewing temperature** - The caffeine content in tea also increases with higher water temperatures because the hotter water accelerates the process of caffeine extraction from the leaves.
- Finally, I found that it takes only about two cups of black tea to obtain about the same amount of caffeine as in a cup of coffee â€” I thought black tea had significantly less caffeine!
