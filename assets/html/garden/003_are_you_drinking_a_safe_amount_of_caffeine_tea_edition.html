Tea Edition</h1><p>Are you a tea drinker who has ever wondered if you&apos;re consuming a safe amount of caffeine? If so, you&apos;re not alone. A recent <a href="https://makeovermonday.co.uk/" target="_blank">MakeoverMonday challenge</a> <a href="https://www.vizwiz.com/2023/03/caffeine.html" target="_blank">2023 week 9</a> on caffeine levels in coffee prompted me to explore what the data looks like for some common types of tea. I suspected many of us tea lovers - with our 5+ cups a day - may be unknowingly exceeding <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678#:~:text=Up%20to%20400%20milligrams%20(mg,widely%2C%20especially%20among%20energy%20drinks." target="_blank">the recommended daily limit for caffeine: 400mg</a>.</p><p>Check out the visualization I created below:</p><p>And here is a summary of what I found interesting from the research process and from my visualization:</p><ul><li>Caffeine is a naturally occurring compound found in up to 28 plants, which use it as a pesticide to protect themselves from insects and other pests. <strong>[1]</strong></li><li>I was surprised to learn that tea leaves actually contain more caffeine than coffee beans on a dry weight basis. However, when preparing a cup of tea, less dry leaf is needed than the amount of coffee beans required to make a coffee, which means the caffeine content in tea is lower per cup. <strong>[2]</strong></li><li>The caffeine content in a cup of tea can vary depending on several factors: <strong>[3]</strong><ul><li><strong>The type of tea leaf used</strong> - Generally, broken down tea leaves, like the ones found in tea bags, yield more caffeine compared to whole leaves.</li><li><strong>The amount of tea used</strong> - The more tea leaves used in brewing, the higher the amount of caffeine.</li><li><strong>Brewing time</strong> - The caffeine content in tea increases as the leaves are left to steep in hot water for a longer period of time. <strong>[4]</strong></li><li><strong>Brewing temperature</strong> - The caffeine content in tea also increases with higher water temperatures because the hotter water accelerates the process of caffeine extraction from the leaves.</li></ul></li><li>Finally, I found that it takes only about two cups of black tea to obtain about the same amount of caffeine as in a cup of coffee â€” I thought black tea had significantly less caffeine!</li></ul><h3>Notes</h3><p><strong>[1]</strong> Source: [Caffeine: Facts, Usage, and Side Effects](https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-trimethylxanthine)</p><p><strong>[2]</strong> Source: [How Much Caffeine is there in a Cup of Tea? | Good &amp; Proper Tea](https://www.goodandpropertea.com/blogs/all/how-much-caffeine-is-there-in-a-cup-of-tea)</p><p><strong>[3]</strong> Source: [How Much Caffeine is in Tea? | BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/health/nutrition/how-much-caffeine-tea)</p><p><strong>[4]</strong> Source: [Caffeine compared: from coke and coffee to aspirin and chocolate](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/nov/27/caffeine-compared-coke-coffee-aspirin-chocolate-tea)</p></div></body></html>
