UK Edition</h1><p>This project began with a realization that there seem to be so many birthdays in September. Is it possible that September is the most common birthday month? I then began wondering about factors that influence conception time. The obvious guess is that most babies are conceived when it&apos;s cold outside, but what in about places where there are no distinct seasons? I sensed a fun puzzle here, so off I went digging to find out more.</p><p>I began by looking through the Tableau Public database to see if anyone had done a visualization on this topic. I found that while there are a good number visualizations done on birthdays <strong>[1]</strong>, most used only US data. I thought it might be interesting for me visualize birthday data for Kenya, my home country, or the UK, where I currently reside. Or even better: both, then compare and contrast my findings. Unfortunately, I couldn&apos;t find any reliable data for Kenya, so I decided to focus solely on the UK.</p><p>Check out what I found below. You can interact with the full visualization on Tableau Public <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/faith5698/viz/HowcommonisyourBirthdayUKEdition/BirthdaysintheUK" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>It turns out that September is indeed the most common month for birthdays in the UK, with September 26, 23, and 30 being the top three birthdays. <a href="https://www.vizwiz.com/2012/05/how-common-is-your-birthday-find-out.html" target="_blank">September is also the top birthday month in the US.</a></p><p>I was surprised to learn that the bottom three birthdays were on holidays: Dec 26, Dec 15, and Jan 1. Is it possible that people deliberately plan pregnancies such that births fall don&apos;t fall on a holiday? Or is it more likely that births, to the extent that it&apos;s possible, are avoided on holidays e.g. via inducing a few days before?</p><p>I also found that December is the most common month for conception, with 26 of the top 30 estimated conception dates <strong>[2]</strong> falling in that month. This must explain all those September birthdays! Now, I wonder why so many babies are conceived in December. Maybe it&apos;s the magic of the holidays: we&apos;re off work, sipping on some festive drinks, and feeling extra cuddly because (baby), it&apos;s cold outside...</p><h3>Notes</h3><p><strong>[1]</strong> I&apos;d like to acknowledge these particular visualizations which inspired mine:</p><ul><li><a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andy.kriebel/viz/MostCommonBirthdays/MostCommonBirthdays" target="_blank">How common is your birthday?
