    <h1> My Last 10 Years in Books </h1>

    <p>
        For a while now, I've wanted to play around with visualizing data on the
         books I've read over the last few years, particularly to discover what genres 
         or themes I lean more toward, and to see how my reading habits have changed 
         over time. Recently, two things happened that made me decide to act on this 
         curiosity.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        First, a friend asked me what my all-time-favourite book is. My answer was, 
        to her disappointment, "it depends." Because it does! What makes a book impactful 
        or transformative depends on when you read it, and what's going on in your life at 
        that time. (1) This got me thinking about my reading journey over the past few years. 
        </li>
        <li>
        Second, I discovered a new alternative to Goodreads called 
        <a href="https://www.thestorygraph.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The StoryGraph</a>, 
        which offers more sophisticated and insightful reading stats. I wanted to transfer 
        my reading records from Goodreads to StoryGraph and in the process, realized that I 
        could export the data I needed to play around with visualizing my reading data myself.
        </li>
    </ul>
